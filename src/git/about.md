# What is Version Control?
Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter. 

Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

For almost all software projects, the source code is like the crown jewels - a precious asset whose value must be protected. For most software teams, the source code is a repository of the invaluable knowledge and understanding about the problem domain that the developers have collected and refined through careful effort. Version control protects source code from both catastrophe and the casual degradation of human error and unintended consequences.

Version control software like Git is widely used in software development, being fluent in operation of it will allow you to better and more efficiently contribute to your team's work.

## Why use git?
There are a multitude of benefits to using version control software like git; the three main ones are:
1. Having a complete long term change history of every file. This means changes made and who by, creation and deletion of files, notes on changes and more.
2. Branching and merging. Infact this resource here has been developed using exactly this process, allowing individuals to work on different stream idependently and then merging them together and handing conflicts.
3. Traceability, being able to track each change and having an annotaed history of the code can enable others to make harmonious changes to the project.
